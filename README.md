# Capstone - **Energy Demand Prediction**

Energy suppliers/companies need to ensure the electricity supply always meets their customersâ€™ demands (reliability of supply) and prevents the supply shortage. As the energy consumptions depend on the time, the day, seasons, and even weather, etc. Companies must estimate/forecast how much electricity to generate, buy from, the price to sell in advance, and whether to invest in various electrical infrastructure.

This project aims to build a time series forecasting model that can predict the electrical consumption of the next day, given the information about the past electricity loads. Here, we focus on the four years of data in Spain. The final goal is to have a model forecasting the range (minimal and maximum) of electricity load from day to day.
